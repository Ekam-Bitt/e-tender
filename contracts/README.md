# Smart Contracts

## Core Contracts
These contracts form the backbone of the e-Tendering system and are considered production-grade.

- **`Tender.sol`**: The main state machine handling the full lifecycle: `Created` -> `Open` -> `Reveal` -> `evaluation` -> `Awarded` -> `Resolved`. It integrates Compliance, Identity, and Logic.
- **`TenderFactory.sol`**: The deployment engine. It uses the UUPS Proxy pattern to spawn cheap, upgradeable (at factory level) tender instances.

## Interfaces (`interfaces/`)
- **`IIdentityVerifier.sol`**: Standard for plugging in different identity providers (e.g., specific GovID issuers or ZK circuits).
- **`IEvaluationStrategy.sol`**: Standard for plugging in different winner-selection logic (e.g., Lowest Price vs. Weighted Score).

## Experimental / Future-Facing
These contracts serve as reference implementations or mocks for future features.

- **`strategies/ZKAuctionStrategy.sol`**: A proof-of-concept strategy that validates ZK Range Proofs instead of raw values.
- **`crypto/ZKRangeVerifier.sol`**: A mock Verifier for ZK proofs. In production, this would be replaced by a Groth16/Plonk verifier generated by Circom.
- **`crosschain/CrossChainAdapter.sol`**: An interface demonstrating how LayerZero/CCIP would hook into `submitBid`.
- **`compliance/ComplianceModule.sol`**: Functional, but in a real enterprise setting, this might emit encrypted logs or interface with a Chainalysis oracle.
